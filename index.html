            <p>On your computer, try slowly resizing the browser window. You should notice that the background image resizes irregularly. Instead of changing the quality of the background image, the original quality is preserved, but some features of the image may be missing or distorted. This program attempts to delete and recreate unimportant sections of the image by analyzing changes in pixel color values.</p>
